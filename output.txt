It is not a program for children of the rich.
It is geared to lower-income families who have fewer prekindergarten options.
FOWLER, Calif.
— David Cardenas, a mechanic and the mayor of Fowler, knows families in his town want high-quality and free daylong preschool.
But options are thin.
A government-subsidized program fills up fast and fits only a small fraction of the town’s 4-year-olds, he said.
A private program that closed a decade ago was unaffordable for many of the 6,500 residents of Fowler, a predominantly Latino community of agricultural workers in California’s Central Valley.
Otherwise, there are a handful of private day cares.
So Mr. Cardenas recently seized on an unusual preschool alternative that a group from Utah presented to him.
“This is something that I have never seen before,” he said.
“I wanted to be on the front line right away.” Mr. Cardenas was referring to a “kindergarten readiness program” for 4-year-olds that takes place almost entirely online.
Called Waterford Upstart and run by a nonprofit group, Waterford.org, it has children spend 15 minutes a day, five days a week over the course of nine months, tapping through lessons on a computer.
About 16,000 children in 15 states graduated from the program this year, and the Waterford expects to expand the program to a projected 22,000 students by 2020.
This is not a program for children of the rich, who are generally enrolled in play-based preschools that last at least several hours.
Instead, it is geared to lower-income families with fewer prekindergarten options.
Like hospitals that have doctors consulting through teleconferencing and elder-care facilities that offer nursing via avatar, online preschools are cheaper than traditional schooling.
Several Democratic presidential contenders  have universal prekindergarten prominently on their agendas.
But the arrival of the digital preschool alternative raises questions about education quality and what exactly preschool is meant to teach.
As the economic chasm in the United States grows, who gets access to human interaction is becoming a stark dividing line through every stage of life.
“Children who come from families of means have always gone to and still go to terrific quality pre-K programs,” said Nancy Carlsson-Paige, a co-founder of Defending the Early Years, a nonprofit campaign promoting universal pre-K.
“Any program, you see the same thing — it’s kids engaged with teachers, blocks, paints and other kids.
It’s all these things that everybody knows is quality.” Not surprisingly, many early-education experts balk at the idea of preschool online.
Steve Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, said a good preschool program typically developed a child’s social and emotional abilities, as well as ingraining lessons like thinking before you act.
“All of that can’t be done online,” he said.
But some advocates and Waterford Upstart argue that an online program is better than the current preschool options available to most low-income families, which are often nothing.
Through the program, children can learn nursery rhymes and letter sounds from the comfort of their homes, with just a computer.
In one lesson, for example, children can listen to a song and watch a video about how “gh” is silent in many words.
The program is free to families that register.
Waterford Upstart says the quality of its videos is higher than most YouTube content for youngsters, and an independent study from 2014 found that children who had completed the reading program outperformed those who hadn’t used it.
For parents like Toni Butler, a single mother of four in Rushville, Ind., who could not afford $164 a week to pay for preschool, Waterford Upstart has been a revelation.
One of her children, Jameson, will graduate from the program on Wednesday.
“Each lesson was animated, so it made it funny and interesting and kept his attention on it,” said Ms. Butler, 34.
The graduation will be the only in-person event of the program, aside from registration.
While the at-home, laptop program is not what longtime advocates of universal pre-K imagined (and some fear it could undermine their fight), it may increasingly be what they get.
Most states have a vast patchwork of preschool choices — some public, some private, half day, full day, local and state run.
But many families still fall in between, earning too much to qualify for public programs while not being able to afford private ones, or living too far from the nearest school.
That has pushed statehouses and city managers to search for other options.
In Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat who is running for president, tried passing bills to bring in money for brick-and-mortar universal pre-K in 2015 and 2017, but the efforts largely failed and the state is now rolling out a Waterford Upstart pilot.
In Indiana, where legislators worked for years on more preschool funding, $1 million was set aside for online kindergarten readiness in 2017.
“We simply don’t have the money to provide a quality pre-K experience to every child in North Carolina, even though I absolutely agree that a face-to-face, high-quality pre-K is the best option,” said State Representative Craig Horn, a Republican leading an effort to get North Carolina to fund an Upstart program.
“But when it’s not an option for the child, I refuse to ignore that child.” Upstart was created by the Utah Legislature in 2009, with Waterford.org, which focuses on technology in education, chosen to provide the program.
The group is funded by state legislatures; private donations from programs like TED’s philanthropic arm, the Audacious Project; and grants from the federal Department of Education.
Claudia Miner, Waterford’s executive director, said Utah had been trying to provide a cost-effective early-education option and turned to tech as a solution.
“For families, private preschool can be as expensive as college,” she said.
“So what do you do?” Now nearly half of Utah’s 4-year-olds are enrolled in Waterford Upstart, Ms. Miner said, and the program has spread to states including Delaware, Mississippi and Wyoming.
Stuart Adams, a Republican state senator in Utah, said the program was a way to serve rural children and religious communities where parents believe young children should be educated at home.
Waterford Upstart costs hundreds of dollars per child, he said, compared with thousands per child in preschools.
Parents are often scared of the idea of an online school, Mr. Adams added, “but once they get past the initial fear and you look at the data, it’s all there.” In Fowler, Mr. Cardenas faces a tight budget for education each year.
So when Waterford reached out to him this year, he was curious.
Instead of building preschools, hiring teachers and navigating thorny transportation logistics, he said, he could watch preschool almost magically manifest in every home through the program.
“I thought this was too good to be true,” he said.
Recently, a dozen families gathered at Fowler’s senior center to hear about the program.
Isaac Troyo, the director of national Upstart implementations, spoke for 30 minutes explaining how it worked, first in English and then in Spanish.
“When your children sit down to use the program, they’re going to learn with games, with songs and puzzles,” he told the audience.
“Activities that are visually appealing and engaging for them, so they’re going to have a good time, but they’re really going to learn all the things that they need to be successful when they get to kindergarten, which is really a win-win.” He said Waterford Upstart would give participants a computer that they would keep, plus internet service for the duration of the program.
Jose, 4, immediately ran up to the front and asked if he could get his computer, prompting laughter.
His mother, Rebecca Molina, 31, once had Jose in a day care program that cost $30 a day.
But Ms. Molina, who is an office clerk, said her husband was a field laborer, which meant gaps in wages between crop cycles.
So they pulled Jose out of the day care.
(Her husband now works at a grocery store.) “It was an internal struggle for me,” Ms. Molina said.
“I wanted him to be with kids his age and in that routine.
But just financially, it didn’t make any sense for us.” Ms. Molina and others at the event said their children were “tablet kids,” often left during the day with relatives and a tablet stocked with youth-oriented content.
When a demo of the program played, it featured an entrancing series of animated sketches focused on letters and sounds.
Even the adults in the room recited the answers.
Resources are scarce in farming towns, said Brenda Quintana, Waterford’s community liaison.
“It’s not like folks are bending over backward to bring in resources for these kids,” she said.
“One of the best things about Waterford is they’re willing to go into these rural areas.” As the event wrapped up, Mr. Cardenas cleaned the room.
The mayor had spent the day canvassing town with the Waterford Upstart team, knocking on doors to encourage families to sign up.
About 50 have signed up so far; the goal for the county is a pilot of 200 families.
“With this program, those kids who were left out in years past, now they’re going to be included,” he said.No one can deny the importance of early learning.
We have years of research by developmental psychologists and early childhood education researchers built on findings to help us understand how preschoolers learn.
We need to fund adequate preschools so students get a good introduction to the joy of formal learning.
Researchers have known for some time that preschool is important for learning.
Steven Barnett and Jason T.
Husted critiqued studies demonstrating the importance of three preschool programs.
The benefits of the High/Scope Perry Preschool program, Abecedarian Early Childhood Intervention program, and the Title I Chicago Child-Parent Centers are well-documented.
Head Start, a federal program created in 1965 to assist children from low-income families has also seen gains in the children it serves, but the program has always been under attack by policymakers who resented paying for the program.
While middle class and the wealthy have access to good preschool, the poor struggle to find affordable preschool that give children access to beneficial early learning.
What’s great about preschool?
Children get to play and learn with other children.
It’s a step beyond a playdate.
They collectively acquire knowledge with activities that they themselves create!
Play is hard work, but preschoolers don’t know it because they are having so much fun.
What a tremendous precursor to learning in school and kindergarten!
Well, that’s how preschool used to be.
One maneuver that has no research in its favor is plopping a three or four-year-old in front of a computer, even in their parent’s lap, to focus on developmentally inappropriate skills.
We’ve known for a while about Waterford UPSTART a Utah-based online preschool program.
This program is being described as a replacement for real preschools.
To save money.
But there’s no research to say this will work.
The well-respected Defending the Early Years (DEY) reports that The Audacious Project housed at TED, as in TED Talks, which funds ideas for social change will throw millions of dollars at Waterford UPSTART.
Here is their letter.
The award winners will be announced at the TED2019 in Vancouver tonight, April 16.
You can follow by tuning in as @TEDTalks livestreams the @TheAudaciousPrj awards 8pm ET/5pm PT and tweet your reactions to UPSTART/online preschool #RejectOnlinePrek.
In 2017, the PBS News Hour examined Waterford UPSTART and noted other online programs.
They include: They seem to be trying to close the achievement gap by forcing children to learn information.
Often it seems beyond what a preschooler should be learning.
For example, the PBS News Hour reports on a mother teaching her preschooler sight words.
When children work online they must focus on skills, not play.
They miss much.
The Audacious Project has your usual corporate school funders.
I wonder if these individuals don’t understand early childhood education.
Have they read the research?
Sitting young children in front of screens to learn will likely have bad long-term repercussions.
We already know that more screen time doesn’t help older children in school.
We also understand that teens are too glued to screens and with social media have become increasingly depressed and anxious.
So there’s little doubt that pushing preschoolers to do their learning on computers is a huge mistake.
We know how important activity and play are to children.
Without it, they miss important early learning foundations.
We also know how poorly children learn with a sedentary lifestyle of viewing and little doing.
Parents are so concerned that programs like Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) are becoming household names.
Parents worry about privacy.
But more than that, they collectively care about how young children are learning and what the future will have in store for all of us if today’s preschoolers don’t learn well.
We will have to fix the mistakes that online learning will cause when good preschool programs fall by the wayside!
What kind of preschool programs will be left for children?
How much will today’s preschooler miss?
Most of us do not reject technology.
It would be hypocritical for a blogger to do so.
Technology is a reality and can be used for good when teaching children, even young children.
But replacing authentic preschools with online programs is not a satisfactory answer.
We have no proof these programs work.
Better funding of real preschools is what’s needed.
Please go the DEY website and read about their fight for good early education.
Start with the report “Young Children in the Digital Age: A Parent’s Guide,” by Early Childhood Specialist Dr. Nancy Carlsson-Paige.
The Devil’s in the Details, Utah September 9, 2016.
“Disruption” Using Technology is Dangerous to Child Development and Public Education  November 13, 2018.
Thanks for this post about the importance of preschool and why technology apps do not replace the benefits that children receive from high quality preschool education.
As a K-3 literacy specialist I see first hand how time spent in preschool helps boost children’s success in primary grade education.
While I think technology and these apps can provide parents with quality supplemental experiences for their child (if they choose to use technology for their children at all).
Your claim that you end with is spot on: what we truly need to focus on is better funding for our preschool.
Here is the state of preschools across the nation in 2017: http://nieer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/State-of-Preschool-2017-Full.pdf.
This document allows us to compare funding, training, and other information and compare state’s to each other.
I live and teach in Arizona and according to this we are 39th for preschool funding, spending $3,590 per preschooler.
Sadly though only about 4% of our preschool age students in Arizona are actually attending preschools.
Seems to me that we must also focus on awareness and promoting preschool access, in lieu of these “apps” that are trying take the place of what we know students need: high quality, real life, preschool experiences.

Bailey · Web Design by HNH Marketing.Waterford UPSTART helps children prepare for their first day of school.
We give parents the tools they need to become their child's first teacher.
That includes adaptive software 15 minutes a day 5 days a week, and parent coaches who give moms and dads the tools necessary to continue working with their kids offline through fun games and tasks that coincide with their children’s lessons.
This is a state-funded program so that means it costs nothing for families.
One of our goals is to reach the most vulnerable populations across Utah.
Whether that’s a refugee family in Salt Lake, or a native family in Monument Valley, we strive to help these children get the education they deserve.
That being said, many of these families don’t have technology in their homes so we provide that as well at no cost.
Children must be 4 years old and starting kindergarten in the fall of 2020.
Faculty will be holding a Waterford UPSTART day tomorrow at Centennial Park in WVC.
Parents can come by any time from noon to 4.
For more information visit WaterfordUPSTART.org.As a father of seven children, I know a thing or two about parenting and I know it can be tough.
Each child is unique and has their own individual needs.
It can feel overwhelming, and many times you wonder if you’re even doing it right.
I also know the value for children of unstructured play and have been a strong supporter of making sure that children in our schools, particularly our young ones, are not overwhelmed by too many academics too early.
There’s no handbook on how to raise your children; we all just grab hold of the resources we can find and try to do our best.
That’s why when I became commissioner of the Department of Education my goal was not only to help children, but also to find tools that could help the parents raising them.
Research shows that a child with an engaged parent will do better in school.
That’s one goal of the Waterford UPSTART program, to help parents engage more in their child’s learning.
When I was first approached about a pilot program starting in New Hampshire, I knew it was something I wanted to support.
Waterford.org has created an early education tool that works for every 4-year-old.
Whether the child is enrolled in preschool, being cared for by a relative, or at home with mom or dad, every child can get an academic boost that will prepare them for kindergarten.
Recently, several professionals from Plymouth State argued in the Monitor that young students should not spend too much time behind computers.
I could not agree more.
I would never support a program that would put our children in front of computers for long periods of time.
Waterford UPSTART is not one of those programs, nor is it an online preschool, as some critics would claim.
Waterford UPSTART prepares children and parents for success in school.
The children get 15 minutes of personalized, online instruction five days a week, but that’s just one piece of this program.
Parents receive support as well through a family coach.
This coach is with the parents every step of the way to answer questions and provide ideas for engaging their child in offline learning, such as reading books together, playing outside, and having rich conversations in the car or on a walk.
Parents are also able to monitor their child’s progress, are given academic and social-emotional tools to use with their children daily and can connect to other families for support.
Waterford UPSTART empowers the parents as much as the child.
Waterford UPSTART has been validated by eight years of rigorous external evaluations in Utah, and a third-party randomized-controlled trial (RCT) shows strong evidence of effectiveness.
That makes supporting them a no-brainer.
I connected them with superintendents across the state to see if there was interest, and there was.
In New Hampshire, we believe in giving our residents a choice.
I saw this as a solution that could work for many of our families.
Let me also clarify that the state of New Hampshire is not spending a single dime on this program.
This pilot, which will help 200 New Hampshire 4-year-olds from economically disadvantaged homes prepare for kindergarten, is completely funded by philanthropic dollars, and Waterford.org is doing all the leg work.
Waterford.org was recognized by the TED organization as one of eight Audacious Projects for 2019, which basically means TED believes this nonprofit program has the ability to change the world.
As an Audacious Project, Waterford UPSTART was given funding to begin pilot programs in states across the nation.
While I completely believe in the power of play-based learning, I don’t believe this is an either/or conversation.
We see far too many children enter kindergarten without the academic knowledge they need to be successful.
All too often, these children are left behind.
The average Waterford UPSTART graduate begins kindergarten reading at nearly a first-grade level.
If we can give families a program that can get their children ready for school on day one, why wouldn’t we want to provide that for them?
I believe Waterford UPSTART will be a great tool for parents and guardians in New Hampshire – a tool that can make the job of parenting just a little easier.
As a young father, I would have cherished a program like this.

(Helena, MT) - Rural Montana families now have a new way to prepare their children for kindergarten at home thanks to a large federal grant.
The United States Department of Education awarded the nonprofit organization, Waterford.org an Education Innovation and Research (EIR) Expansion Grant with a goal of finding solutions to rural educational challenges in five western states through the Waterford UPSTART program.
Montana is the fourth largest state in the country but there’s an average of only seven people per square mile.
The communities and reservations are isolated and rural, yet the state is home to more than 800 schools and 400 school districts.
Montana’s Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jule Walker, recognizes the state’s challenges and believes Waterford UPSTART could affect positive change, saying, “Montana is a rural state with many families unable to access early childhood education opportunities within their local community.
UPSTART will allow parents to access high-quality early education resources online, giving families the ability to jumpstart their child’s education regardless of where they live in our state.” This $14.2 million grant will bring the Waterford UPSTART program to five Western states.
The pilots began in Wyoming, North Dakota, and Idaho last year, now South Dakota and Montana are enrolling for 2020.
Waterford.org was awarded the EIR expansion grant after successfully serving rural families in Utah.
“We’re grateful to be recognized for the important work we’ve been doing in Utah for a decade,” said Benjamin Heuston, CEO of Waterford.org.
“Across the country, some 2.2 million 4-year-olds lack access to early education, and we’re eager to put this grant to use helping students in five more states prepare for a successful academic career, no matter their location or socioeconomic background.” Families can register by going to www.waterfordupstart.org Spots are limited and enrollment ends May 15, 2020.
Restrictions apply.

We empower parents as a child’s first teacher, and we support teachers in taking the right actions at the right time for their students.
In total, Waterford.org serves more than 300,000 children every year through all of our programs, and that number is continually growing.
Waterford UPSTART helps four-year-old children prepare for school at home and at no cost.
Children develop foundational reading and social-emotional skills, and parents are empowered to become their child’s first and most influential teachers.
The children use adaptive software just 15 minutes a day, five days a week in the year before they start school.
Waterford UPSTART also fuels family involvement in their child’s early education through parent coaches and fun educational activities parents can complete with their children offline.
Waterford UPSTART has been rigorously tested and proven, earning the program a federal EIR grant and the title of a TED Audacious project.
Independent research shows the average Waterford UPSTART graduate enters kindergarten reading at nearly a first-grade level and maintains those gains through the fourth grade.

Waterford UPSTART will offer Montana families online access to early education tools in the upcoming school year.
(Photo: PinkPueblo, Getty Images/iStockphoto) A multi-million dollar grant will provide rural families in Montana, and four other western states, an opportunity for their children to access early education options at home through Waterford UPSTART program beginning next school year.
The Waterford UPSTART program aims to find solutions to rural educational challenges by helping 4-year-old children and their families prepare for kindergarten using adaptive software to develop foundational reading and social-emotional skills.

The program is available to participants at no cost.
According to the website, a new computer and internet can be provided for families if needed to participate in the program.
"Montana is a rural state with many families unable to access early childhood education opportunities within their local community," said Montana's Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Jule Walker in a press release from Waterford.
"UPSTART will allow parents to access high-quality early education resources online, giving families the ability to jump-start their child's education regardless of where they live in our state." The Waterford UPSTART program was created by Waterford.org, an early education nonprofit.
The nonprofit's mission is to achieve universal literacy for children through equity, access, and parent empowerment by developing educational tools that guide students along individualized plans towards fluent reading and lifelong learning.
Each year, the nonprofit serves more than 300,000 children through its programs.
Waterford UPSTART pilot programs began last year in Wyoming, North Dakota and Idaho, now South Dakota and Montana are able to enroll in the program thanks to a $14.2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education.
According to the media release from Waterford.org, the nonprofit previously received an Education Innovation and Research Expansion Grant after its success with serving rural families in Utah as well.
"We're grateful to be recognized for the important work we've been doing in Utah for a decade," said Benjamin Heuston, CEO of Waterford.org.
"Across the country, some 2.2 million 4-year-olds lack access to early education, and we're eager to put this grant to use helping students in five more states prepare for a successful academic career, no matter their location or socioeconomic background." Waterford UPSTART offers preschool-aged children access to academic support while also encouraging parents to be their child's first teacher.
According to the release, children use the software for 15 minutes a day, five days a week in the year before they start kindergarten.
The Waterford.org website indicates that the average graduate of Waterford UPSTART enters kindergarten reading at nearly a first grade level.
"Our goal is to try to fill gaps in early learning...
which in rural states, there are plenty of gaps since many families don't have access to preschool," wrote Fischer in an email.
"When that's the case, parents must step up and help prepare their kids, but many of them don't know how.
That's where our program is helpful.
We give parents the tools they need to help their kids." In Montana, legislation supporting public preschools has failed in the last three legislative sessions, meaning that access to early education is not universal.
The Great Falls Public School district has relied on grants to fund its preschool for the last decade, which serves low-income students as well as students with special needs from seven different elementary neighborhoods.
Enrollment in the program is limited for the upcoming school year, however the pilot will be available for two years in Montana.
According to Kim Fischer, the director of public relations for Waterford.org, 200 students will be accepted for the first year in Montana, in the 2021-2022 school year 400 students will be able to participate in the program.
To be eligible for enrollment for the 2020-2021 school year children must enter kindergarten in 2021 with a birth date between Sept.
11, 2015 and Sept.
10, 2016.The pilot is only available to families living in a "rural code," but Fischer said that all locations in Montana are eligible to register, as the whole state is considered rural.
Families can register online at www.waterfordupstart.org through May 15, 2020.
© 2020 Great Falls Tribune, a division of Gannett Company, Inc.Waterford.org was awarded an Education, Innovation and Research (EIR) expansion grant to combat early education challenges in states with significant rural populations that lack options for state-funded preschool.
Montana is eligible to participate in Waterford’s software-based preschool program.
Waterford UPSTART was created as a software-based program designed to prepare children for kindergarten and empower parents as a child’s first educator.
“Kids do better when they feel like they’re being supported by their parents,” Kim Fischer, director of public relations for Waterford, said.
Waterford UPSTART began as a partnership between Waterford and Utah State Legislature 11 years ago.
At that time, the state was looking for a way to prepare families and their children, with limited preschool access, for kindergarten.
Similar to Montana, Utah has rural areas and spread out populations.
It was realized that putting money solely into preschools may not end up benefitting the whole population.
A legislator in Utah had heard of Waterford and the discussion turned to how access could be provided to families without having a preschool nearby.
“We already do this in the schools, so how can we do it in the homes?” Fischer asked.
Pam Birkeland, Superintendent of Schools in Madison County, recalled working at schools in Helena, Mont.
and coming across students who did not know how to hold a book when entering kindergarten.
It takes a lot of work to catch up after starting behind, and students are 25% more likely to drop out if beginning public education this way, Dr. Claudia Miner, executive director of UPSTART, said in a TEDX talk.
“It (Waterford UPSTART) provides everyone who participated the opportunity to have their children in a more ready spot to go to school and be successful in school,” Birkeland, who recently spent time learning about Waterford UPSTART at an event, said.
Being a first-time parent to a child about to enter school brings up multitudinous questions.
It is not always obvious what you are supposed to do to prepare children for school, Birkeland said.
UPSTART aims to guide parents through the process with a software program.
For 15 minutes each day, five days a week, parents work on reading, math and socioemotional skills with their children for a school-year period of time the year before entering kindergarten.
The algorithm caters to the child’s needs by identifying areas that need extra time.
Families are given a computer and internet access if they do not already have it, and if at least 80% of the program is completed, they keep the computer.
They have access to the software program until their child enters kindergarten.
To enroll, parents may go to waterfordupstart.org and start the process.
A summer orientation will be provided for Montana families this year to familiarize parents with the program.
A personal parent coach checks in on families as they go through the process and are there for guidance.
80% of those enrolled must meet certain rural codes.
Families looking to be a part of the program living in larger areas will be put on a waitlist until the 80% criteria is met.
After it is, families in larger areas can enroll on a first come first serve basis.
The goal is to reach all families in need.
Having this education outside a brick and mortar setting and screen time were brought up as causes for concern.
In-school options for young students do exist around Madison County.
Twin Bridges has a funded preschool program and Alder has a free Running Start program that unable to make use of this option because of cost.
“We always have a handful of kids that go to preschool of some sort and we always have a handful that don’t have any previous experience,” Ms. Konopacki said.
If students are on the young side of the spectrum and lack a form of preschool education, they often repeat kindergarten.
Fischer brought up the fact that screen time is just part of our world now.
It is more a question of what type of screen time and how much, rather than if it should be allowed.
UPSTART aims for interactive, educational and high-quality screen time.
Dr. Miner explained the wide range of UPSTART.
It can be used for anything from providing for underserved students to supplementing existing preschool programs.
Whatever early education problem there is, UPSTART aims to find a way to help.
“We like to remind people we are not trying to replace anything.
We are only trying to fill the gaps,” Fischer said E-Edition AccessThe Madisonian E-Edition is available to subscribers only.

Before he could even respond, his parent said, “Oh, he’s not in school yet.” It’s a simple anecdote, perhaps forgettable, but it reveals an attitude that’s becoming more pervasive than it should be with parents of young children: that school is where learning begins, that education doesn’t happen at home, but with teachers.
I’m a firm believer, however, that the family is a child’s first teacher.
At Marion County School District, we embody that philosophy and share it with our community to ensure students enter our schools ready on the first day.
Here’s how we do it.
The first step must happen in the home.
Conversations, reading to children, asking them about the things they learn in preschool, and many other interactions families have with their young children all contribute to their education.
A lot of parents don’t see the value of their role in educating their child, whether because they didn’t have academic success themselves or simply because they think only institutional education qualifies as teaching.
Parents are a huge piece of the puzzle, however, and we need to help them fill that role.
We repeatedly tell them, “Your role is very important and you’re equipped to teach your child.” Simply saying that, however, is not enough.
Next, educators must walk the talk and make early education a priority within our district.
This has recently become easier through the South Carolina Child Early Reading and Development Program.
Available in most South Carolina districts, this program helps us ensure that eligible four-year-olds in our district receive high-quality preschool.
The number of seats funded through CERDEP is limited, however, and not all students are eligible.
We are fortunate to be able to extend a supplemental program, Waterford UPSTART, to students enrolled in our program.
This program provides parents no-cost access to high-quality early learning with a personalized online curriculum focused on literacy, numeracy, and early STEM concepts.
If the family doesn’t have a laptop or Internet access, Waterford will provide them, again at no cost.
Bringing children into the district for preschool demonstrates our commitment to early learning, but it doesn’t necessarily empower families to take themselves seriously as teachers of their own children.
For that, we look to partnerships with the larger community.
Marion County is a Title I district, so we’re required to hold parenting activities.
Within the schools, we have all the traditional gatherings, such as Donuts for Dads and Muffins for Moms, but we pair those fun events with some learning for the parents.
Parent breakfasts, for example, are great community-building events in their own right, but we want family members who attend to participate in a workshop as well.
Several times throughout the school year, each of our schools offers parent workshops with activities that support the curriculum.
We also partner with our faith communities.
In a rural community such as ours, connection to a faith-based institution is something most of our students share, and the respect their family members hold for clergy is significant.
We leverage that by working with faith-based organizations.
Often that’s as simple as passing along information or resources to the clergy.
I have a regular coffee chat with clergy members and I always provide them with resources such as a high-frequency word list to share with their communities.
They get packets for every grade from kindergarten to 5th, and I encourage them to make it part of their Sunday school or create some kind of challenge for their young people to participate in.
We also like to extend invitations to these folks related to whatever is going on in the district.
We say, “If you need us to come to your church for some type of event, our staff will be on site.
We can provide some type of workshop to make sure parents are engaged.” At my most recent coffee chat, for example, my math coordinator came along with me and extended an open invitation by saying, “I hear parents are struggling with this new math.
I'm willing to come and have a math workshop at your church.” In these high-tech times, there are many other ways for us to reach our community members.
As I write this, I’m looking forward to expanding upon the many opportunities to reach our families through webinars and podcasts.
I also go on the old-fashioned radio once a quarter to provide updates and other information, because not everyone is a tech whiz.
Many of our grandparents, for example, take a very active role in raising our students, but most of them aren’t downloading podcasts.
They do know how to tune a radio, though!
We are actively working right now on strengthening our connections with our local daycares.
Our relationships with these centers are good, but we’re acting to improve the academic nature of those relationships by looking at how we can best align our education objectives.
Do we need to share our curriculum with them?
Do we need to include them in some of our training?
We can’t just say, “Those children are with daycares now so we don’t need to worry about what they’re learning.” Children in all the local daycare facilities will someday soon be Marion County students, so we do have to ensure that they have the experiences they need to come to our district ready to learn.
As educators, we’re advocates for children, but we can’t do it on our own.
We have to be advocates for families, as well.
As the African proverb says, it truly does take a village.

| Privacy Policy | Terms of Use| CCPA "Do Not Sell My Personal Information"As a proud grandfather of 15 beautiful grandchildren, I find joy in life’s little milestones: Their first steps, the sound of their first words and the way their precious faces light up when they learn something new.
I know grandparents across Utah feel the same way.
We all want what’s best for our grandchildren.
Supporting my own grandchildren’s future happiness and success motivates much of my work as president of the Utah Senate.
I often ask myself what more can we do, as a state, to set all children up for success.
Research shows 90% of a child’s brain will develop before they enter kindergarten.
That’s why it’s so important to support not only children but the entire family during these formative years.
State leaders and local nonprofits are working together to bring attention to this important topic and continue to improve Utah’s early childhood development.
Combining our voices and efforts will maximize our impact as we work to help families succeed.
I am proud to say Utah is full of organizations and individuals working together to support families with young children, and many of them will be joining us at the Capitol for Early Childhood Day on the Hill on March 2.
Some work directly with children, some work with caregivers and others work at the policy level to remove barriers to young children’s success and create programs promoting optimal early childhood development.
I personally am a strong supporter of the early childhood education program UPSTART.
It was created in 2009 through a partnership between the Utah Legislature and the nonprofit Waterford.org.
This at-home, early learning program engages both children and parents in learning.
Through the Waterford UPSTART program, parents get a personal coach along with tips and tools to help their children grow socially and academically.
The program was initially designed to help low-income families, children who are not native English speakers and children in many rural areas of our state, where brick-and-mortar classes traditionally haven’t worked.
After years of rigorous research and field testing, we know UPSTART has measurable long-term academic impacts.
Participating children also see social and emotional gains before entering school.
After compelling positive outcomes, the state expanded the UPSTART program to reach even more children.
Whether or not children attend preschool, they can do the program at home with their parents for an academic boost.
I am proud to say other states have seen the success of this Utah-made program and are now using it to improve their early childhood education and development gaps.
While the statistical results are impressive, seeing my 4-year-old grandson benefit from the UPSTART program has had the biggest impact on me.
While laying a foundation for success in reading, science and math, his self-esteem blossomed.
Watching that process and knowing he was ready for school gives me a great deal of comfort, and I am so proud he is doing so well.
Whether we are 4 or 40, we all do better when we are confident and well prepared.
I invite parents to come by the Utah Statehouse for Early Childhood Day on the Hill on March 2.
Speak with participating organizations and your local legislators and let us know why you believe optimal early childhood development matters.
While there’s no handbook for parenting, organizations in our state can provide tools and techniques to help parents and children succeed.
They can help parents improve early childhood outcomes, and make raising confident, kindergarten-ready kids a little easier.
As legislators, most of us are parents and grandparents and therefore have a vested interest in early childhood development in our state.
We’ll continue working to create programs promoting success.
Good beginnings lead to good futures, and the future of our children is the future of our state and nation.

Start your day with the top stories you missed while you were sleeping.Early childhood education, It’s not something that everyone can afford or get access to in rural North Dakota, but one National Non-Profit Organization is entering its second year of making sure every child gets an equal opportunity at a headstart and local families are finding the benefits in it.
Waterford UPSTART is an online program that found it’s way to North Dakota a year ago to help families in rural areas help their four-year-olds prepare for Kindergarten, completely free.
“This really helps families that don’t have access to preschool, because of money.
Preschool is pretty expensive and it really helps give a boost to those kids who don’t have a chance to go to preschool,” says Bismarck UPSTART Mom, Stephanie Ewert.
The program is quite simple 15 minutes a day for five days a week creates the groundwork for child development.
Brittany and Matthew Barraco’s son, Noah, first got involved 5-months ago, and already, he’s reading, writing and doing math on a 1st-grade level.
“We’ve watched him kind of work through it with the program as it takes it back a level or moves it around and just watching him actually get the skills, it’s just amazing to see the excitement he gets on his face,” Brittany Barraco says.
Waterford UPSTART is also offered in other states like Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota and Montana and thanks to a $14.2 million federal grant from The United States Department of Education more than 2,500 lessons are provided.
Along with a computer to complete them on.
“They make it fun and it takes a lot of the work off of us to be as creative and critical thinking wise as far as to get our kids to learn these concepts.” Matthew Barraco says.

HELENA – Rural Montana families will now have a new way to prepare their children for kindergarten at home thanks to a large federal grant.
The United States Department of Education awarded the nonprofit organization, Waterford.org an Education Innovation and Research Expansion Grant with a goal of finding solutions to rural educational challenges.
Waterford.org says with Montana being the fourth largest state in the country, a lot of those families in rural areas don’t have access to preschool and this grant will help those children have an opportunity to early childhood education.
“The best thing we can do is empower the parents as the child's first teacher and give them the tools they need to prepare their child,” says Kim Fischer, Director of Public Relations, Waterford.org.
“So when they walk into the door that first day of kindergarten, they are ready to go.” The federal grant will fund the Waterford UPSTART Program which will help educate parents on how to be their child’s first teacher.
The program will allow parents to log in and track their child’s progress to see where they’re excelling or where they may be falling behind, along with giving them the tips they need to address those things.
“The whole idea of Waterford UPSTART is to get children ready to go before that first day of kindergarten, so they start off on the right path throughout the rest of their schooling,” says Fischer.
This $14.2 million grant will bring the Waterford UPSTART Program to five western states, including Montana.
They will be enrolling 200 children into the program this year and up to 400 children by the start of the next school year.
Waterford says this program will help take the burden off of parents and help give them the tools they need to help their kids.

For a second year, rural families across North Dakota have the opportunity to participate in a program that will help their four-year-olds prepare for school.
These additional resources are thanks to a $14.2 million federal grant.
The United States Department of Education awarded the nonprofit organization, Waterford.org an Education Innovation and Research (EIR) Expansion Grant with a goal of finding solutions to persistent challenges experienced by rural families in five western states through the Waterford UPSTART program.
Waterford.org was awarded the EIR expansion grant after successfully serving rural families in Utah.
“We’re grateful to be recognized for the important work we’ve been doing in Utah for a decade,” said Benjamin Heuston, CEO of Waterford.org.
“Across the country, some 2.2 million families with 4-year-olds lack access to resources that help children get ready for kindergarten, and we’re eager to put this grant to use helping students in five more states prepare for a successful school experience, no matter their location or socioeconomic background.” The pilots are enrolling for year two in Wyoming, North Dakota, and Idaho.
South Dakota and Montana are also now enrolling for 2020.
Chris Jones, Executive Director of ND’s Department of Human Services says, “North Dakota sees this as an opportunity to empower families to create time and space to learn and play together.” For more information go to www.waterfordupstart.org Spots are limited.
Enrollment ends June 29, 2020.

Waterford.org Waterford.org is an early education nonprofit with a mission to achieve universal literacy for children through parent empowerment, equity, and access.
Waterford develops tools that assist students along individualized learning paths toward social-emotional learning such as saying please and thank you and lifelong learning.
Waterford empowers parents as a child’s first teacher and supports teachers in taking the right actions at the right time for their students.
In total, Waterford.org serves more than 300,000 children every year through all our programs, and that number is continually growing.
Waterford UPSTART helps four-year-old children prepare for school at home and at no cost.
Parents are their child’s first and most influential teachers and with this program, they can help children develop foundational reading and social-emotional skills.
The children go through personalized lessons with a family member for 15 minutes a day, five days a week in the year before they start school.
Waterford UPSTART also fuels family involvement in their child’s early education through parent coaches and fun educational activities parents can complete with their children offline.
Waterford UPSTART has been rigorously tested and proven, earning the program a federal EIR grant and the title of a TED Audacious project.

We're always interested in hearing about news in our community.
Let us know what's going on!RAPID CITY, S.D.
(KOTA TV) -  South Dakota families now have a new way to prepare their children for kindergarten at home thanks to a large federal grant.
Waterford.org is a nonprofit receiving $14.2 million.
The goal of the organization is to bridge the early learning gap for rural pre-school aged kids through its Upstart program.
It's heading to South Dakota this year after major success in Utah.
Legislators there appreciated the work Waterford.org staff were doing and wanted to find a way to get that education into the home.
That's how the Upstart program started with plenty of research and other federal government grants.
"They wanted to see how well we did in rural areas and did a lot of research.
After that I3 (Investing in Innovation) Grant proven to be so successful, they ended up giving us this EIR grant to then try it in the rural areas in 5 western states so that includes Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming," said Waterford.org Public Relations Director Kim Fischer.
It all starts with a mobile phone or a computer.
Parents receive push notifications to do a small lesson with their children for 15 minutes a day, five days a week.
"It is adaptive.
It is personalized to that student.
It's online and all of it costs nothing for families.
If a family needs a computer or internet access we provide that as well at no cost.
We give parents topics they can discuss with their children, whether its jealousy or anger but ways they can address those feelings as well," said Fischer.
It takes about 8 minutes to sign up for the program.
Parents will start receiving phone calls from the organization after that.
They also get their own coach to help them through the process, answering any questions or concerns and check in every so often.
Locally, South Dakota education officials believe it's a unique opportunity, getting kids ready to start the school process.
"What we've seen in our state is a lot of our kiddos aren't ready for kindergarten, just the simple vocabulary skills, learning how to talk.
So if we can start at a younger age with 3, it's so neat to see how ready kids are when they go into school.
It's truly aimed at the kiddos that may not have those same opportunities to go to a building preschool but to still have that same opportunity," said South Dakota Statewide Family Engagement Center Project Director Morgan VonHaden.
Around 150-180 families across the state will get the chance to use the program this year.
Rapid City and Sioux Falls are the two areas that don't qualify for the program because they're considered urban, not rural.
VonHaden is excited to get tablets into the hands of students and create a nice ripple effect everywhere.
"They're getting excited because then by the time they do go into kindergarten, they already have a bit of a foundation.
They're learning those oral skills, so when the teacher gets to talk to them and works with them and the families, they've already gotten that foundation," said VonHaden.
Montana is another state enrolling in the program for 2020.
Wyoming, North Dakota and Idaho were part of a pilot program last year.

The free and reduced lunch rate varies from about 35% at some of our schools to more than 90% at several.
Like most urban districts, our city is a regional hub for social services, medical services, and retail for communities within about 100 miles.
Like a rural district, however, Wichita Falls is not on the way to or from anywhere.
You have to want to come here, and so we struggle to attract teachers.
Our goal, then, is not just to educate children, but to make this a community where families want to live.
But with a stagnant population, the only way to ensure that our community will grow and thrive is to “grow our own,” so that those who live here are able to participate fully in our economy and everything that we have to offer families.
That, in turn, means that we have to prepare each student for kindergarten so they have a solid foundation for the education that follows.
Here’s how we do it.
The need for early learning really can’t be overstated.
I always say, “We’ve got to get them to the same starting line,” because if every one of our students is at that line by the time they start school, they tend to do pretty well.
Here’s what we find on day one: some students walk in ready to learn.
These students have had rich early childhood education opportunities.
Others were not as fortunate and they need more help.
Some are just learning English for the first time.
We work to catch them up as best we can, but once that gap opens it’s extremely difficult to close again, especially with the constraints of the 180-day school year in Texas.
In Wichita Falls, we’ve worked to keep that gap from opening by funding full-day PreK for qualifying students for about 20 years.
Fortunately, the state legislature just allocated funds for early education, so now we have nearly enough funding from the state to cover all qualifying students, which includes English language learners, military dependents, homeless students, economically disadvantaged students, and migrants.
For us, that’s about 800 students each year who are now funded through the state instead of district coffers.
Before our students even get to PreK, we offer them a state-recognized, blue-ribbon “parents as teachers” program that serves about 120 families each year.
As part of this grant-funded program, certified teachers go into the homes of students who are younger than four years old, usually for about 18 months.
Weekly or bi-weekly, these teachers work with parents to get them aligned with social services if they need them and to teach them why it’s important to read to their children.
We also run our own Head Start program, which begins at three years old for qualifying students and serves about 500 children each year.
If you walked into one of our Head Start classrooms, you wouldn’t be able to differentiate it from one of our standard PreK classes.
They use the same curriculum, taught by teachers with the same certification, and have the same expectations of students.
We still have about 100-150 students who, for one reason or another, aren’t served by any of the above programs.
There may be a transportation issue, or their parents may have work schedules that interfere or any number of other challenges.
For those students, we use the Waterford UPSTART program.
The nonprofit Waterford.org provides families a Chromebook and internet access at no cost so their children can access the organization’s personalized online early learning curriculum.
We ask them to spend 20 minutes a day, five days a week during the entire year before kindergarten, working on early literacy skills, letter recognition, number recognition, color recognition, and more.
Two years ago, our director of early learning, Travis Armstrong, said, “It was so awesome to finish PreKRoundup because not a single student that wanted PreK services was turned away.” That was the first year that we were able to say that nearly all of our students either had some sort of early learning service or that their parents felt they had it under control themselves.
Our work is paying off: This year, for the first time in the last six, we are now above the state average in kindergarten readiness.
And our district, which accounts for about 50% of our region, is above our region’s average.
There’s always more work to be done, but with a focus on young children, parents, and community, we believe we’re on the right path.
As we look to next year, we’re always seeking additional funding sources within Wichita Falls.
It’s always encouraging to have a local family foundation share our commitment to the future of our community.
Michael Kuhrt is the superintendent of schools at Wichita Falls Independent School District, which partners with Head Start and Waterford.org to deliver early learning services.

| Privacy Policy | Terms of Use| CCPA "Do Not Sell My Personal Information"In her living room, 4-year old Autumn isn’t just playing an on-line video game.
She’s attending preschool.
“Learning to put words together,” she says.
“To make words.” Run almost entirely online, it’s called Waterford Upstart.
“We were just looking for an alternative to the preschool options that were here,” her mother Vanity Ray said.
“It’s not an extra bill.
It’s not an added stress on so many families that’s already strained with finances anyway.” Preschool can be expensive– ranging from $4500 to $13,000 per year but this simple program requiring just 15 minutes a day, five days a week is free.
The goal is to bring educational tools to children earlier, improving literacy and ensuring kids are ready for Kindergarten.
“What’s happening right now is if you have just a one size fits all model, you’re going to be leaving a lot of children behind,” Waterford President and CEO Dr. Benjamin Heuston said.
“So we’re trying to keep children on that track towards literacy.” Early education experts, though, say programs like this- can leave kids behind in other ways.
“Part of the way in which we measure quality, is the social interactions, of the children with other children and the children with the adults in the care,” Kathy Hirsh-Pasek of the Brookings Institute said.
“All that happens in the mix of a high quality preschool education.” “One day I came in and she’s like, ‘Dad. we learned about syllables today’,” Autumn’s father Neil Ray said.
“And I’m like, ‘OK’.
I’m like, ‘How many syllables the syllable have?
And that became a game for like 15, 20 minutes of us, me throwing words out.
Her counting the syllables.” For more information or to register your child, go to waterfordupstart.org Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (ABC4 News) - A former Brigham Young University employee is speaking out against the school's Honor Code clarification.
"I feel the need to speak out because I think I am uniquely positioned as someone who's had a lot of experience from inside the organization at BYU and has had a lot of close inner interaction with the administration at BYU to understand some of the things that are going on there," said Allison Phillips Belnap.
SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4 News) - Two bills making waves in education funding are one step closer to your November ballot: SJR 9 and HB 357.
These two bills are tied to each other and tied to your vote in November because they recommend a change to Utah's constitution.
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — After Brigham Young University two weeks ago dropped a section from its strict code of conduct that had prohibited all expressions of homosexual behavior, bisexual music major Caroline McKenzie felt newfound hope that she could stop hiding and be herself.
She even went on a date with another woman.
That optimism was pierced this week when administrators at the university-owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints clarified in a letter posted online Wednesday that “same-sex romantic behavior” was still not allowed on campus.
The letter said the recent revision to what is known as the “honor code” didn't change the “moral standards” of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.
